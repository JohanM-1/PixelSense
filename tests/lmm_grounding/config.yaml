  User instruction: {prompt}
  
  Please decompose this task into a sequence of low-level UI actions.
  If the task involves moving an item (drag and drop), you MUST provide the start coordinate (the item to move) and the end coordinate (the destination container).
  
  Format your answer strictly as a JSON list of objects.
  Use normalized coordinates [0-1000] for all bounding boxes (0=top/left, 1000=bottom/right).
  
  Example for "Move item A to column B":
  [
    {{"action": "drag", "start_bbox": [100, 200, 150, 250], "end_bbox": [400, 200, 500, 600], "description": "Drag 'Item A' to 'Column B'"}}
  ]
  
  Example for "Click on Submit":
  [
    {{"action": "click", "bbox": [10, 20, 30, 40], "description": "Click 'Submit' button"}}
  ]
  
  Now, provide the JSON for the user instruction.
