# PixelSense

PixelSense is a comprehensive repository of tools and testing frameworks designed for both local and cloud-based AI models.

## Overview

The core objective of PixelSense is to bridge the gap between AI models and their operational environment. By providing a structured system for context understanding and scope determination, this project aims to:

- **Enhance Contextual Awareness**: Enable AI to fully understand the environment it operates in.
- **Prevent Hallucination**: Minimize "divagation" or irrelevant outputs by strictly defining and organizing the context.
- **Determine Scope**: clearly define the boundaries of the AI's knowledge and capabilities for a given task.
- **Action Generation**: Facilitate accurate, context-driven actions based on the analyzed environment.

## Features

- **Hybrid Toolset**: Supports testing and integration for both local (on-device) and cloud AI solutions.
- **Context Organization**: structured approach to feeding environmental data to the AI.
- **Scope Management**: Tools to limit and guide the AI's focus to prevent errors.

## Getting Started
